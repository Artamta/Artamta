## 🔬 About Me  
I’m a **computational researcher** working at the intersection of **machine learning, deep learning, and scientific computing**.  
My focus areas:  
- 🌦️ **Climate data** — spatio-temporal forecasting, extreme events, graph-based models  
- 🧠 **Biomedical imaging** — quantitative MRI, cancer prediction, emotion recognition  
- ⚡ **HPC** — scalable pipelines on Slurm clusters, SSH-based workflows  
- 🤖 **AI/ML** — transformers, graph neural networks, LLM/RAG  

> I love designing **reproducible pipelines** and building models that are not just accurate but also interpretable and impactful.
