# Hi, I'm Ayush! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a research student passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. I enjoy exploring how data can be transformed into meaningful insights and building models that solve real-world problems. My expertise spans across Python, MATLAB, and SQL, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges in the field of AI and data-driven decision-making.
