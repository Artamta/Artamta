Profile
I am a computational researcher passionate about addressing real-world problems in climate science and healthcare using
data-driven techniques. My expertise lies in machine learning, deep learning, and high-performance computing
(HPC/Slurm, SSH). I design and implement scalable and reproducible pipelines in Python and PyTorch for spatio-temporal
climate forecasting and quantitative biomedical imaging. I bridge statistical modeling, transformers, graph neural
networks, and LLM/RAG to produce interpretable and impactful solutions.
Research Experience
Fuxi Model Implementation (Transformers for Climate Data), IISER Pune
Supervisor: Prof. Bedartha Goswami
• Implementing a Fuxi-style transformer combining Swin and U-Transformer principles for spatio-temporal
forecasting on gridded climate data.
• Developing scalable PyTorch training pipelines, custom dataloaders for multi-year arrays, and conducting
ablation studies on extreme-event prediction.
• Leveraging HPC clusters (Slurm, SSH) for training and large-scale experiments.
• Timeline: Aug 2025 – Present
• Repository: github.com/Artamta/Fuxi-Weather-Prediction
Summer Research Internship — Quantitative MRI, Centre for Biomedical Engineering, IIT Delhi
Supervisor: Dr. Amit Mehndiratta / Dr. Esha Baidya Kayal
• Implemented voxel-wise IVIM and hybrid IVIM-DKI models with Total Variation regularization to improve
parameter-map stability under low SNR.
• Built end-to-end pipelines for DICOM/NIfTI handling (NiBabel, SimpleITK), ROI selection (MRIcron), and
nonlinear fitting (scipy.optimize, lmfit).
• Conducted synthetic SNR simulations and multi-organ clinical analyses (Liver, Lymphoma, Prostate, Rectum);
evaluated with RMSE, bias, and AIC.
• Timeline: May – Jul 2025 (3 months)
• Repository: github.com/Artamta/Summer_Internsip_IITD
Spatio-Temporal Climate Data Analysis for the Indian Subcontinent, IISER Pune
Supervisor: Prof. Bedartha Goswami
• Performed large-scale analysis of temperature and NDVI time-series to identify heatwave clusters and seasonal
anomalies.
• Implemented clustering (K-means, UPGMA) and Deep Graphs workflows for spatio-temporal pattern discovery.
• Applied Spearman-rank correlation analyses and developed publication-quality geospatial maps.
• Leveraged Python, Xarray, GeoPandas, and HPC (Slurm) for experiments.
• Timeline: Dec 2024 – Jul 2025 (8 months)
• Repository: github.com/Artamta/Spito-Temporal_Heatwave_Analysis

10th: 93.6%, 12th: 93.2% | CBSE Merit Certificate (Science)
Selected Projects
Facial Emotion Recognition System (Course Project: Image & Video Processing with Deep Learning)
• Designed and implemented a deep learning pipeline for emotion recognition using the CK+ dataset (7 classes:
Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Contempt).
• Built on a VGG19 backbone, adapted for grayscale inputs, with dropout and weight decay for regularization.
• Implemented a 5-fold cross-validation pipeline in PyTorch, achieving an average test accuracy of 73.9% and a
best fold accuracy of 79.8%.
• Applied extensive augmentation (random rotation, affine transforms, perspective distortion, erasing) for
generalization.
• Developed an inference pipeline (predict.py) for classifying unseen face images.
• Timeline: Semester 6 (Summer 2024)
• Repository: github.com/Artamta/project_ayush_raj
Breast Cancer Detection Model (Practice Project)
• Built and evaluated a logistic-regression classifier on clinical features (97% accuracy on held-out test); deployed
a Flask demo for interactive use.
• Timeline: Winter 2023
• Repository: github.com/Artamta/Brest_Cancer_Detection_Model
